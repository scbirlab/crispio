Command-line utilities and Python API for designing CRISPRi experiments in bacteria.

**crispio** makes it easy to design annotated and systematically named libraries of guide RNAs. 
Alternatively, **crispio** can map a FASTA of existing guides to a genome.

**Hint**: If you have a table of guide RNAs from the literature that you want to annotate
with genomic features, **crispio** is your tool. Use [`bioino table2fasta`](https://github.com/scbirlab/bioino#command-line) 
to convert the table to a FASTA file, then use [`crispio map`](#mapping-known-guide-rnas-to-a-genome).
